# [WIP] Arduino ML with TensorFlow üëæ

This repo will contain the source code from a side project I'm working on, that uses Arduino ML with TensorFlow.

The project uses an artificial neural network to control...

> **Note:** More details will be added soon.

The repo structure of the contents is the following:

- [Section 1. A brief explanation about neural networks _(soon)_]()
- [Section 2. Connection with the accelerometer/gyroscope (MPU6050 module) _(soon)_]()
- [Section 3. Data connection with Python _(soon)_]()

### Material ‚úÇÔ∏è

You need the following material:

- 1 x [Arduino UNO]() or an [Arduino Nano]()
- 1 x MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope module
- 1 x Breadboard
- 1 x Breadboard jumper wires (male to male)
- More coming soon...


### Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started, you'll need the following:

1. Arduino IDE installed on your computer
2. Detailes about needed (extra) libraries for Arduino are mentioned on each corresponding section
3. More coming soon...
